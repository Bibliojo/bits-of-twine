## Check APCs
That great journal you found? It charges an Article Processing Charge (APC). 💸

Do you have funding?

### ✅ If yes:
- Your **grant** may cover it.
- Western Libraries supports **transformative agreements** via [CRKN](https://www.crkn-rcdr.ca) so you may not have to pay at all.
  - Check our [fancy spreadsheet](https://www.lib.uwo.ca/scholarship/oasupport.html) to see which journals offer discounts or full coverage.

### ❌ If no:
- Try a **[Diamond OA journal](#diamond-dig)** (no fees!).
- Or go **[Green OA](#green-win)** by depositing your Accepted Manuscript in a repository.
