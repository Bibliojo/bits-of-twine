Since this is the part of github that I find most difficult to bend my head around, I am goin over this skil piece yet agian :) Versio control is terrific. and I have an old site that I want to bring up to date, and I need to review how to do that, since is was over 4 years ago. .


"These changes will be made only to the README file on your readme-edits branch, so now this branch contains content that's different from main."
make the additon to the brahch, main  remains the sam. .  commit changes to brach. .  but main remains the same. . . got it? LOL

next Now that you have changes in a branch off of main, you can open a pull request.

Pull requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub. When you open a pull request, you're proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch. Pull requests show diffs, or differences, of the content from both branches. The changes, additions, and subtractions are shown in different colors.

As soon as you make a commit, you can open a pull request and start a discussion, even before the code is finished.
