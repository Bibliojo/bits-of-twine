:: Start
You’ve finally finished your manuscript—hooray! 🎉 Now, it’s time to share it with the world. But how? And where? You want your work to be widely read, maybe even reused and cited. Ideally, Open Access... but how?

What’s your top priority?

[[Reach the widest audience (open access)|OA Goals]]
[[Publish in a specific journal (prestige matters)|Prestige Path]]
[[Avoid paying publishing fees (budget's tight)|Diamond Dig]]

:: OA Goals
You want people to read your work—no paywalls, no restrictions.

You check the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) and find a few promising candidates.

[[Submit to a journal listed in DOAJ|Check APCs]]
[[Go back and choose another path|Start]]

:: Check APCs
The journal is fully open access... but they charge an Article Processing Charge (APC). You’ll need to pay to publish.

Do you have funding?

[[Yes – I have a grant |Funded Path]]
[[No – I need a journal with no APCs (diamond OA)|Diamond Dig]]

:: Diamond Dig
You discover a journal that’s fully open access *and* free to publish in! 🥳 It's part of the diamond OA landscape—funded by libraries, consortia, or societies.

You submit, and your article is accepted. Congratulations, scholar! You’ve published open access with no fees to you or your readers.

:: Prestige Path
You’ve got a target journal in mind—one your mentor loves and everyone in your field reads. But it’s not open access by default.

You check the journal's policies using [Jisc's Open Policy Finder](https://openpolicyfinder.jisc.ac.uk) and learn that:

[[You can pay to make it open (Hybrid OA)|Check APCs]]
[[You can deposit your Accepted Manuscript in a repository (Green OA)|Green Win]]
[[You cannot share at all – rethink your journal? 😬|Start]]

:: Green Win
You publish in your target journal and upload the accepted manuscript to your institution’s repository. It’s free, legal, and discoverable!

Green Open Access FTW! 🎉

[[Play again?|Start]]

:: Funded Path
You use grant money or library support to cover the APC. Your article is published fully open access and is available to readers around the world.

Success!

:: Predatory Pitfall 🕳️ [hidden]
🚨 You’re deep into the publishing jungle when a flashy journal appears...

"Publish in 48 hours!" it cries. "Just $1,299 (USD)!" 🤑

Before you hit *Submit*, a friendly librarian in stylish red glasses zips in, trumpet slung over her shoulder. 🎺

**BiblioJo whispers:**  
"That journal's got more red flags than a marching band. Let’s take a closer look."

🚩 **How to Spot a Predatory Publisher**

❗ **Red Flags (aka the 'Tells'):**

1. **Aggressive Email Solicitation**  
   _“Dear esteemed researcher, we read your excellent paper in [journal you never published in]...”_

2. **No Peer Review or Unrealistically Fast Turnaround**  
   📅 Peer review in 2 days? That’s not how real science works.

3. **Vague or Missing Editorial Board**  
   👀 Can you *verify* the names and affiliations? If not, beware.

4. **Poor Website Quality**  
   🖥️ Typos, broken links, blurry logos = 🚫

5. **Hidden or Dodgy APCs**  
   💸 Surprise charges after acceptance = classic predatory move.

6. **Dubious Indexing Claims**  
   🔍 Always verify indexing in Scopus, DOAJ, or Web of Science.

7. **Fake Impact Factors**  
   📈 “Global Impact Factor 97” is not a real metric. Look for trusted sources.

8. **Low-Quality or Irrelevant Content**  
   📝 Shallow, unrelated articles are a red flag.

✅ **What to Look For:**
- Indexed in [DOAJ](https://doaj.org), [Scopus](https://www.scopus.com), or [Web of Science](https://mjl.clarivate.com/)
- Transparent peer-review and ethical policies
- Recognized publisher (university press, Springer, etc.)
- Clear or no APCs (💎 hello, Diamond OA!)

💡 **Pro Tip:**  
Ask your librarian at [rsclib@uwo.ca](mailto:rsclib@uwo.ca)—they can help vet journals using Cabells, Ulrichsweb, and pure librarian instinct.
